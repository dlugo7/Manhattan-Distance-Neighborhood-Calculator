# Manhattan Distance Neighborhood Calculator

A clean, interview-ready solution for calculating Manhattan distance neighborhoods in 2D grids. This project provides two distinct approaches perfect for technical interviews.

## üéØ Two-Tier Interview Structure

### 1. **Core Algorithm** (`interview_solution.py`)
- **Purpose**: Pure algorithm implementation with test cases
- **Perfect for**: Algorithm-focused interviews
- **Features**: Clean code, hardcoded test cases, no GUI complexity
- **Run**: `python interview_solution.py`

### 2. **Visual Demonstration** (`gui_demo.py`)
- **Purpose**: Professional GUI with interactive visualization
- **Perfect for**: Full-stack skill demonstration
- **Features**: Dark theme, real-time updates, custom grid creation
- **Run**: `python gui_demo.py`

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Algorithm Interview Mode

python interview_solution.py
```
**Perfect for**: Shows core algorithm implementation without distractions

### Visual Demo Mode
```bash
python gui_demo.py
```
**Perfect for**: Demonstrates advanced development skills

## üìã Problem Statement

Calculate the number of unique cells within Manhattan distance N of any positive values in a 2D grid.

**Manhattan Distance Formula**: `|x1-x2| + |y1-y2|`

**Key Requirements**:
- Each cell counted only once (no duplicates)
- Positive cells count as 0-distance members
- Works with any valid grid dimensions
- Handles edge cases and boundaries

## üîß Core Algorithm

Located in `interview_solution.py`:

```python
def calculate_manhattan_neighborhood(grid: List[List[int]], n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate unique cells within Manhattan distance N of positive cells.
    
    Time Complexity: O(P √ó N¬≤) where P = positive cells
    Space Complexity: O(N¬≤) for neighborhood storage
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

## üé® Visual Demo Features

## üìä Test Cases

The interview solution includes comprehensive test cases:

1. **Single Positive Cell** - Basic functionality
2. **Multiple Positive Cells** - Overlapping neighborhoods
3. **Boundary Cases** - Edge and corner positions
4. **Dense Grid** - Many positive cells
5. **Single Cell** - Minimum grid size (N=0)
6. **Large N** - N larger than grid dimensions
7. **No Positive Cells** - Empty grid handling
